		<h3> There is only one true love in this world .... yes that is right! The love between a dog and its people.  </h3>
		<p> John Grogan: "A dog has no use for fancy cars, big homes, or designer clothes. A water log stick will do just fine.
       A dog doesn't care if your rich or poor, clever or dull, smart or dumb. Give him your heart and he'll give you his. 
       How many people can you say that about? How many people can make you feel rare and pure and special? How many people 
       can make you feel extraordinary."</p>
